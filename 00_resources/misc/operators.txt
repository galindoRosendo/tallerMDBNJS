Comparison

For comparison of different BSON type values, see the specified BSON comparison order.

Name	Description
$eq	Matches values that are equal to a specified value.
$gt	Matches values that are greater than a specified value.
$gte	Matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.
$lt	Matches values that are less than a specified value.
$lte	Matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value.
$ne	Matches all values that are not equal to a specified value.
$in	Matches any of the values specified in an array.
$nin	Matches none of the values specified in an array.


Logical

Name	Description
$or	Joins query clauses with a logical OR returns all documents that match the conditions of either clause.
$and	Joins query clauses with a logical AND returns all documents that match the conditions of both clauses.
$not	Inverts the effect of a query expression and returns documents that do not match the query expression.
$nor	Joins query clauses with a logical NOR returns all documents that fail to match both clauses.

Element

Name	Description
$exists	Matches documents that have the specified field.
$type	Selects documents if a field is of the specified type.

Evaluation

Name	Description
$mod	Performs a modulo operation on the value of a field and selects documents with a specified result.
$regex	Selects documents where values match a specified regular expression.
$text	Performs text search.
$where	Matches documents that satisfy a JavaScript expression.


Geospatial

Name	Description
$geoWithin	Selects geometries within a bounding GeoJSON geometry. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $geoWithin.
$geoIntersects	Selects geometries that intersect with a GeoJSON geometry. The 2dsphere index supports $geoIntersects.
$near	Returns geospatial objects in proximity to a point. Requires a geospatial index. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $near.
$nearSphere	Returns geospatial objects in proximity to a point on a sphere. Requires a geospatial index. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $nearSphere.


Array

Name	Description
$all	Matches arrays that contain all elements specified in the query.
$elemMatch	Selects documents if element in the array field matches all the specified $elemMatch conditions.
$size	Selects documents if the array field is a specified size.

Bitwise

Name	Description
$bitsAllSet	Matches numeric or binary values in which a set of bit positions all have a value of 1.
$bitsAnySet	Matches numeric or binary values in which any bit from a set of bit positions has a value of 1.
$bitsAllClear	Matches numeric or binary values in which a set of bit positions all have a value of 0.
$bitsAnyClear	Matches numeric or binary values in which any bit from a set of bit positions has a value of 0.

Comments

Name	Description
$comment	Adds a comment to a query predicate.
Projection Operators

Name	Description
$	Projects the first element in an array that matches the query condition.
$elemMatch	Projects the first element in an array that matches the specified $elemMatch condition.
$meta	Projects the document’s score assigned during $text operation.
$slice	Limits the number of elements projected from an array. Supports skip and limit slices.


======================================================================

Update Operators

Fields

Name	Description
$inc	Increments the value of the field by the specified amount.
$mul	Multiplies the value of the field by the specified amount.
$rename	Renames a field.
$setOnInsert	Sets the value of a field if an update results in an insert of a document. Has no effect on update operations that modify existing documents.
$set	Sets the value of a field in a document.
$unset	Removes the specified field from a document.
$min	Only updates the field if the specified value is less than the existing field value.
$max	Only updates the field if the specified value is greater than the existing field value.
$currentDate	Sets the value of a field to current date, either as a Date or a Timestamp.
Array

Operators

Name	Description
$	Acts as a placeholder to update the first element that matches the query condition in an update.
$addToSet	Adds elements to an array only if they do not already exist in the set.
$pop	Removes the first or last item of an array.
$pullAll	Removes all matching values from an array.
$pull	Removes all array elements that match a specified query.
$pushAll	Deprecated. Adds several items to an array.
$push	Adds an item to an array.
Modifiers

Name	Description
$each	Modifies the $push and $addToSet operators to append multiple items for array updates.
$slice	Modifies the $push operator to limit the size of updated arrays.
$sort	Modifies the $push operator to reorder documents stored in an array.
$position	Modifies the $push operator to specify the position in the array to add elements.
Bitwise

Name	Description
$bit	Performs bitwise AND, OR, and XOR updates of integer values.
Isolation

Name	Description
$isolated	Modifies the behavior of a write operation to increase the isolation of the operation.
